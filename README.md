# siRNA Gene inhibition Predictor

This is a project showcasing my capabilities in supervised machine learning and model deployment.

### Libraries
Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Streamlit

### Introduction
RNA interference is an important biological mechanism to repress gene expression in eukaryotic organism. inhibition of mRNA by endogenous miRNA or by exogenous siRNA. Usage of siRNA is an interesting drug mechanism to use in gene induced disease. effectivity of siRNA in represing a gene can be measured by looking at its thermodynamic stability.
The objective of this project is to create a prediction model predicting the effectiveness of miRNA inhibition on gene expression activity.
